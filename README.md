Twitter Webintent Demo using Angular.js
=========

Basic application that mostly uses routes/configs to demo Twitter's webintent functionality for posting/retweeting/following twitters.

  - This work's original intent was to be able to login into twitter using javascript alone , from a third party web app, and then tweet/retweet/follow etc.
  - In researching the existing OAuth1.0a approach that twitter currently uses, it looks like they deprecated the use of strictly javsacript solutions a while ago. Their advice now is to use server side user identity validation. This work does not use that approach, but will build a demo at some future point, possibly using java or python.
  - A secondary task was to internationalise the language of the site. That has also not been done and is a work-in-progress.
